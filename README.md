# Snake Game

## Introduction

The Snake Game is a classic and entertaining arcade-style game where players control a snake that grows in length as it consumes food. The objective is to guide the snake to eat food items without colliding with the walls or itself.

## Technologies Used

1. **HTML:** The structure of the game is defined using HTML, including the game canvas and other necessary elements.
2. **CSS:** Styles are applied to enhance the visual appeal of the game, defining the appearance of the snake, food, and overall layout.
3. **JavaScript:** The game logic is implemented using JavaScript, responsible for handling user input, updating the snake's position, checking for collisions, and managing the game state.
4. **Python:** A simple Python server is employed to serve the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the client.

## Components

### 1. HTML Structure

- The game canvas is defined using the `<canvas>` element.
- Score and other information are displayed using HTML elements.

### 2. CSS Styling

### 3. JavaScript Game Logic

- **Initialization:** The game starts by initializing the snake's position, direction, and the initial food location.
- **User Input:** Arrow keys are used to change the snake's direction.
- **Game Loop:** A loop continuously updates the game state, moving the snake and checking for collisions.
- **Collision Detection:** The game logic checks for collisions with the walls, itself, or food.

- **Scoring:** The player's score is updated based on the number of food items consumed.
- **Game Over:** The game ends if the snake collides with a wall or itself.

### 4. Python Server

- A simple Python server is used to serve the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the client.
- It facilitates communication between the client and server for a seamless gaming experience.

## How to Play

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
3. Guide the snake to eat the food and grow in length.
