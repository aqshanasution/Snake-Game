    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>The Snake Game is a classic and entertaining arcade-style game where players control a snake that grows in length as it consumes food. The objective is to guide the snake to eat food items without colliding with the walls or itself.</p>

    <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML:</strong> The structure of the game is defined using HTML, including the game canvas and other necessary elements.</li>
        <li><strong>CSS:</strong> Styles are applied to enhance the visual appeal of the game, defining the appearance of the snake, food, and overall layout.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> The game logic is implemented using JavaScript, responsible for handling user input, updating the snake's position, checking for collisions, and managing the game state.</li>
        <li><strong>Python:</strong> A simple Python server is employed to serve the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the client.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Components:</h2>
    <h3>HTML Structure:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The game canvas is defined using the &lt;canvas&gt; element.</li>
        <li>Score and other information are displayed using HTML elements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>CSS Styling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Styling is applied to create a visually appealing game interface.</li>
        <li>The snake, food, and other game elements are styled to enhance the gaming experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>JavaScript Game Logic:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Initialization: The game starts by initializing the snake's position, direction, and the initial food location.</li>
        <li>User Input: Arrow keys are used to change the snake's direction.</li>
        <li>Game Loop: A loop continuously updates the game state, moving the snake and checking for collisions.</li>
        <li>Collision Detection: The game logic checks for collisions with the walls, itself, or food.</li>
        <li>Growth: When the snake consumes food, it grows in length.</li>
        <li>Scoring: The player's score is updated based on the number of food items consumed.</li>
        <li>Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with a wall or itself.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Python Server:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A simple Python server is used to serve the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the client.</li>
        <li>It facilitates communication between the client and server for a seamless gaming experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Play:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the HTML file in a web browser.</li>
        <li>Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.</li>
        <li>Guide the snake to eat the food and grow in length.</li>
        <li>Avoid collisions with walls and the snake's own body.</li>
        <li>Aim for a high score by consuming as much food as possible.</li>
    </ol>
